# memory

This is a version of the classic card game Memory. The user is presented with a board of n*m cards. Select two cards. If they match, the cards stay flipped and the user is rewarded with 2 points. If the cards do not match, they flip back and the user loses one point. IT IS POSSIBLE TO GO NEGATIVE as an incentive to use as few moves as possible. 

The art is original art by Nancy Organ.
